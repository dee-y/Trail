# Trail
Trail is a personal, open-source project developed using ReactJS which is intended to track your task completion at a given time, creating a collection of logs by the end of the day for you to be proud of.

#### Remaining Task(s)

    * Delete, Mark as complete, Edit etc.
2. Store our tasks in `localStorage` for the time being.

3. Count total tasks in each categories and display it.
4. Reset all Tasks.
5. ..
